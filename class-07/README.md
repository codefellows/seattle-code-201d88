-[CONSTRUCTOR REPLIT](https://replit.com/@arpatterson31/Class-201d88-CONSTRUCTORS#index.js)
-[IN CLASS DEMO CODE - CONSTRUCTOR REFACTOR AND TABLE EXAMPLE](inclass-demo/)

## Overview

This class will introduce inheritance with constructor functions, plus adding another dimension to dynamic DOM rendering by creating a table instead of lists from stored array data.

## Class Outline

- Code Review of previous lab assignment
- Code Demo
  - Constructor functions
  - Prototype methods
  - Dom Manipuation with HTML tables
- Lab preview and prep

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- Constructor functions
- JavaScript "prototypal inheritance"
- HTML `<table>` tag structure and usage

#### Execute

- Translate an object literal into a constructor function.
- Use the ‘prototype’ property to extend the inheritable properties and methods of a constructor function.
- Dynamically build a semantic HTML table with with JavaScript and render it to the DOM.

## Notes

1. What is a Constructor function?

1. How does the term `this` differ when reference an object literal versus a Constructor function?

1. What are some HTML elements that make up an HTML table?
